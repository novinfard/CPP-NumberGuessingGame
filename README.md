# Number Guessing Game

Design and Implement a program that represents a number guessing game. The game generates a random integer in the range 1000 to 9999 and prompts the user to guess the value. Invalid guesses (ie. ones that are outside the range, none integer etc) should receive an error message reminding the user of the range. Valid guesses that are above or below the random value should receive a message that indicates whether they are too high or too low. When the number has been guessed, print the number of valid guesses that the user took. It then should ask the user whether to play again. User may input “quit” to quit the game at any time.

Notes:
- Separate header file, source code file and main program.
- Consider Class encapsulation and information hiding.
- Check the C++ reference for generating a random integer.
